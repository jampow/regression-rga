# Regression Test Example

The following is an example of the use of automated regression tests, I'm using Selenium Webdriver, Capybara and Cucumber (They deserves a full page to talk about its benefits and best practices).

## Getting Started

We have all the scenarios at **features >> specs**
We are going to automate some regression test for RGA website.

### Prerequisites

* Cucumber
* Capybara
* Ruby

## Running the tests

Save the repository to a local folder, them on the terminal, just run the command ```cucumber```
