# Regression Test Example

The following is an example of the use of automated regression tests, I'm using Selenium Webdriver, Capybara and Cucumber (They deserves a full page to talk about its benefits and best practices).

## Getting Started

We have all the scenarios at **features >> specs**
We are going to automate some regression test for RGA website.

### Prerequisites

* Ruby
* Cucumber (to install Cucumber, run ```gem install``` cucumber)

## Running the tests

Save the repository to a local folder, them on the terminal, run ```bundle install``` 
Then just run ```cucumber```
